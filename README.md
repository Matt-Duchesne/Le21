To whom this may concern,

This project was made in the context of a mid-semester evaluation for the course 
"Programmation interactive client-serveur". The goal of this project was to directly apply
the diverse programming concepts we had learned thus far this semester. Mainly, ES6 classes and OOP.
My grade for this project was 100%, so I am very proud of this particular one. I have done other, more ambitious
projects that I'm very fond of but as this is the most recent one and that the code itself is what you are evaluating,
I believed this would be the best choice for now. If you wish to see more, it will be my pleasure to upload those too!

--- The project itself! ---

The idea was to create a very simple card game akin to blackjack called "le 21". The game is a simple
"push your luck" card game where the player but try to get as close to 21 as possible without busting.
Rules were slightly simplified; in a normal game, an ace is worth 1 or 11. In this case, it is simply worth 11.
All figures are worth 10 and every other card is worth it's face value.

Another small simplification was that "deck management" was not asked of us, so a simple random function was used along with a 
single suite of cards (hearts). Since cards are not "removed" from the deck, multiples copies of the same card can appear. 
As some would say.... this is not a bug, it's a feature ; )

Main tasks were: 
	- Displaying the information
	- Game logic (card values, win conditions, etc)
	- Player logic (whose turn is it?, skipping over players who lost/passed)

Feel free to check the included "enonc√©.pdf" for the complete details on what was required of us for this exam.

Since this was imposed for evaluation purposes, I obviously did not choose this project. 
I did, however, went to great lengths to give a personnality to it way beyond what was required.
The example given to us was a text-based game with no images, sounds, or any CSS to speak off as the 
goal was to test our coding abilities first and foremost. I decided to go all out and make something 
I would be proud of!

I added:
	- Card images and grid display
	- Sound effects and music.
	- win/lose/pass effects 
	- Getting as close to a classy casino aesthetic as possible without expensive licensed images
	(fun fact: I had to get the felt texture for the player areas from an online fabric store as every good one
	I found elsewhere was a licensed image! Finding all the assets was fun... albeit quite time consuming!)

As very simple this project probably is for an experienced coder, for me this was quite the endeavor and I've invested at least 3 times the
amount of time that would normally be required. I am very happy about the end result and I hope you won't be too harsh
on my rookie mistakes (I'm sure there are plenty! I imagine some of you would refactor this in 10 lines!).
Should you have any questions on this, by all means, contact me and it will be my pleasure to discuss with you : ) 

Thank you very much for reading this and I hope to hear from you soon!

Have a very nice day!

Matt
